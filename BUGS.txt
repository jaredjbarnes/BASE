Only starting component's jQuery data survives.  This affects tags and "componentLoaded" data.
To see:
	* Drop a breakpoint around line 303, in loadControllers, around here:
		var tags = $element.closest("[component]").data("componentTags");
        var instance = new Controller(element, tags);
	* Add a watch for this:
		$(element).data("componentLoaded")
	* Notice that (even on the tag test) only the last, outermost component returns a value for that watch expression

I also discovered that the "clone" built in loadComponentsDeep -> buildDomAsync -> componentCache.loadComponent (abt 332)
is not the same element as you get in loadControllers (around line 303 as mentioned above).  For one of my
components I set the clone to the window and compared when it hit loadControllers and it was not the same.
